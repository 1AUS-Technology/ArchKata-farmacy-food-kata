# About the team Name
Miyagi's Little Forests is certainly an unusual name for a dev team. The name has both a pop-culture and an academic reference: 
- Mr. Miyagi is the shy Karate master in the 1984 "The Karate Kid" film. In the movie, which inspired a generation of then teenagers including two members of this team, Mr. Miyagi teaches the young Daniel-san the ancient art of Karate. The teaching of this martial art is anchored on Katas. Hence the nuanced connection to our architecture challenge.
